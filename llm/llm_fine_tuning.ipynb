We used the GRADE framework to rate our certainty of the evidence in each meta‐analysis as high, moderate, low or very low.\",\n",

Study participants had an average age of 64 years and percentage predicted FEV 1 of 51.5% (medians of study means).

There is little to no difference between LAMA+LABA and LAMA+ICS in the odds of having a serious adverse event. Whilst all‐cause death may be lower with LABA+ICS, there was a very small number of events in the analysis, translating to a low absolute risk. Findings are based on moderate‐ to high‐certainty evidence from heterogeneous trials with an observation period of less than one year. This review should be updated again in a few years.\"},\n",

Medical therapy for dysmenorrhoea includes oral contraceptive pills (OCP) and nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which both act by suppressing prostaglandin levels. While these treatments are very successful there is still a 20 to 25% failure rate and surgery has been an option for such cases. Uterine nerve ablation (UNA) and presacral neurectomy (PSN) are two surgical treatments that have become increasingly utilised in recent years due to advances in laparoscopic procedures. These procedures both interrupt the majority of the cervical sensory pain nerve fibres. Observational studies have supported the use of these procedures for primary dysmenorrhoea.

For the treatment of secondary dysmenorrhoea six identified RCTs addressed endometriosis and one included women with uterine myomas. The treatment of LUNA combined with surgical treatment of endometrial implants versus surgical treatment of endometriosis alone showed that the addition of LUNA did not aid pain relief. For PSN combined with endometriosis treatment versus endometriosis treatment alone there was an overall difference in pain relief although the data suggests this may be specific to laparoscopy and for midline abdominal pain only.

            "You are an expert article reviewer. You are supplied with ditailed medical article abstract. Your task is to generate very accurate PICO eligibility criteria (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome). <article_abstract> <article_title> Long‐acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) plus long‐acting beta‐agonist (LABA) versus LABA plus inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease </article_title> <background>Long‐acting beta‐agonists (LABAs), long‐acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), and inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are inhaled medications used to manage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). When two classes of medications are required, a LAMA plus an ICS (LABA+ICS) were previously recommended within a single inhaler as the first‐line treatment for managing stable COPD in people in high‐risk categories. However, updated international guidance recommends a LAMA plus a LABA (LAMA+LABA). This systematic review is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2017.</background>\n",
            "<objectives>To compare the benefits and harms of LAMA+LABA versus LABA+ICS for treatment of people with stable COPD.</objectives>\n",
            "<search_methods>We performed an electronic search of the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Search Portal, followed by handsearches. Two review authors screened the selected articles. The most recent search was run on 10 September 2022.</search_methods>\n",
            "<selection_criteria>We included parallel or cross‐over randomised controlled trials of at least one month's duration, comparing LAMA+LABA and LABA+ICS for stable COPD. We included studies conducted in an outpatient setting and irrespective of blinding.</selection_criteria>\n",
            "<data_collection_and_analysis>Two review authors independently extracted data and evaluated risk of bias. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs), and continuous data as mean differences (MDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Review Manager 5. Primary outcomes were: participants with one or more exacerbations of COPD; serious adverse events; quality of life, as measured by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score change from baseline; and trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ). We used the GRADE framework to rate our certainty of the evidence in each meta‐analysis as high, moderate, low or very low.</data_collection_and_analysis>\n",
            "<main_results>This review updates the first version of the review, published in 2017, and increases the number of included studies from 11 to 19 (22,354 participants). The median number of participants per study was 700. In each study, between 54% and 91% (median 70%) of participants were males. Study participants had an average age of 64 years and percentage predicted FEV 1 of 51.5% (medians of study means). Included studies had a generally low risk of selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting biases. All but two studies were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, which had varying levels of involvement in study design, conduct, and data analysis.</main_results>\n",
            "<authors'_conclusions>Combination LAMA+LABA therapy probably holds similar benefits to LABA+ICS for exacerbations and quality of life, as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, for people with moderate to severe COPD, but offers a larger improvement in FEV 1 and a slightly lower risk of pneumonia. There is little to no difference between LAMA+LABA and LAMA+ICS in the odds of having a serious adverse event. Whilst all‐cause death may be lower with LABA+ICS, there was a very small number of events in the analysis, translating to a low absolute risk. Findings are based on moderate‐ to high‐certainty evidence from heterogeneous trials with an observation period of less than one year. This review should be updated again in a few years.</authors'_conclusions> </article_abstract> Please provide your awnser in the following format: <format> Population: (PICO eligibility criteria 1), (PICO eligibility criteria 2), ... Intervention: (PICO eligibility criteria 3), (PICO eligibility criteria 4), ... Comparison: (PICO eligibility criteria 5), (PICO eligibility criteria 6), ...

It has been suggested that wearing compression stockings might reduce this risk. This is an update of the review first published in 2006.</background>\\n<objectives>To assess the effects of wearing compression stockings versus not wearing them for preventing DVT in people travelling on flights lasting at least four hours.</objectives>\\n<search_methods>The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and AMED databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 1 April 2020. We also checked the bibliographies of relevant studies and reviews identified by the search to check for any additional trials.</search_methods>\\n<selection_criteria>Randomised trials of compression stockings versus no stockings in passengers on flights lasting at least four hours. Trials in which passengers wore a stocking on one leg but not the other, or those comparing stockings and another intervention were also eligible.</selection_criteria>\\n<data_collection_and_analysis>Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. We sought additional information from trialists where necessary.</data_collection_and_analysis>\\n<main_results>One new study that fulfilled the inclusion criteria was identified for this update. Twelve randomised trials (n = 2918) were included in this review: ten (n = 2833) compared wearing graduated compression stockings on both legs versus not wearing them; one trial (n = 50) compared wearing graduated compression tights versus not wearing them; and one trial (n = 35) compared wearing a graduated compression stocking on one leg for the outbound flight and on the other leg on the return flight. Eight trials included people judged to be at low or medium risk of developing DVT (n = 1598) and two included high\\u2010risk participants (n = 1273). All flights had a duration of more than five hours.</main_results>\\n<authors'_conclusions>There is high\\u2010certainty evidence that airline passengers similar to those in this review can expect a substantial reduction in the incidence of symptomless DVT and low\\u2010certainty evidence that leg oedema is reduced if they wear compression stockings. The certainty of the evidence was limited by the way that oedema was measured. There is moderate\\u2010certainty evidence that superficial vein thrombosis may be reduced if passengers wear compression stockings. We cannot assess the effect of wearing stockings on death, pulmonary embolism or symptomatic DVT because no such events occurred in these trials. Randomised trials to assess these outcomes would need to include a very large number of people.</authors'_conclusions> </article_abstract> Please provide your awnser in the following format: <format> Population: (PICO eligibility criteria 1), (PICO eligibility criteria 2), ...

We also contacted pharmaceutical companies .</search_methods>\\n<selection_criteria>Randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of continuous intravenous infusion versus bolus intravenous administration of loop diuretics in congestive heart failure were included</selection_criteria>\\n<data_collection_and_analysis>Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility, methodological quality and did data extraction. Included studies were assessed for validity. Authors were contacted when feasible. Adverse effects information was collected from the trials.</data_collection_and_analysis>\\n<main_results>Eight trials involving 254 patients were included. In seven studies which reported on urine output, the output (as measured in cc/24 hours) was noted to be greater in patients given continuous infusion with a weighted mean difference (WMD) of 271 cc/24 hour (95%CI 93.1 to 449; p<0.01). Electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) were not significantly different in the two treatment groups with a relative risk (RR) of 1.47 (95%CI 0.52 to 4.15; p=0.5). Less adverse effects (tinnitus and hearing loss) were noted when continuous infusion was given, RR 0.06 (95%CI 0.01 to 0.44; p=0.005). Based on a single study, the duration of hospital stay was significantly shortened by 3.1days with continuous infusion WMD \\u20103.1 (95%CI \\u20104.06 to \\u20102.20; p<0.0001) while cardiac mortality was significantly different in the two treatment groups, RR 0.47 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.69; p<0.0001). Based on two studies, all cause mortality was significantly different in the two treatment groups, RR 0.52 (95%CI 0.38 to 0.71; p<0.0001).</main_results>\\n<authors'_conclusions>Currently available data are insufficient to confidently assess the merits of the two methods of giving intravenous diuretics. Based on small and relatively heterogenous studies, this review showed greater diuresis and a better safety profile when loop diuretics were given as continuous infusion. The existing data still does not allow definitive recommendations for clinical practice and larger studies should be done to more adequately settle this issue.</authors'_conclusions> </article_abstract> Please provide your awnser in the following format: <format> Population: (PICO eligibility criteria 1), (PICO eligibility criteria 2), ...

However, the study was criticised for many reasons and the real effect of this treatment is still not known conclusively.</background>\\n<objectives>To determine whether bypass surgery plus medical care is superior to medical care alone in patients with sCAO.</objectives>\\n<search_methods>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched June 2009). In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2009) and EMBASE (1980 to June 2009).

We only analysed secondary outcomes if the study provided information on at least one primary outcome. We also used intention\\u2010to\\u2010treat analysis where possible.</data_collection_and_analysis>\\n<main_results>We included 21 trials, including two RCTs, involving 2591 patients. For all endpoints, no benefit of EC/IC bypass surgery was shown either in the RCTs (any death: odds ratio (OR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.05, P = 0.11; stroke: OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.23, P = 0.91; death and dependency: OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.21, P = 0.64), or in the non\\u2010RCTs (any death: OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.62, P = 0.99; stroke: OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.18, P = 0.25; death and dependency: OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.29, P = 0.37).</main_results>\\n<authors'_conclusions>EC/IC bypass surgery in patients with sCAO disease was neither superior nor inferior to medical care alone. However, most studies included patients irrespective of their cerebral haemodynamics. Participation in an ongoing RCT, which is restricted to patients with impaired haemodynamics, is recommended as these patients might benefit from bypass surgery.</authors'_conclusions> </article_abstract> Please provide your awnser in the following format: <format> Population: (PICO eligibility criteria 1), (PICO eligibility criteria 2), ...

Most GRADE assessments gave very low\\u2010certainty evidence, downgrading mostly for high risk of bias and serious imprecision.</main_results>\\n<authors'_conclusions>Data on the effectiveness, safety and women's experiences of home versus inpatient induction of labour are limited and of very low\\u2010certainty. Given that serious adverse events are likely to be extremely rare, the safety data are more likely to come from very large observational cohort studies rather than relatively small RCTs.</authors'_conclusions> </article_abstract> Please provide your awnser in the following format: <format> Population: (PICO eligibility criteria 1), (PICO eligibility criteria 2), ...

Experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies were contacted regarding unpublished material.</search_methods>\\n<selection_criteria>All randomised controlled trials that compare treatment with inositol, whether as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy, to an alternative treatment, whether another antidepressant medication or placebo, for patients with a diagnosis of depressive disorder (diagnosed according to explicit criteria).</selection_criteria>\\n<data_collection_and_analysis>Data were independently extracted from the original reports by two reviewers.

Research has found that communication skills can impact on a person's recall and understanding of the diagnosis, treatment options and prognosis. People may feel confused and perplexed when information about their illness is not communicated properly. Sharing information about diagnosis of a serious mental illness is particularly challenging. The nature of mental illness is often difficult to explain since there may be no clear aetiology, and the treatment options and prognosis may vary enormously. In addition, newly diagnosed psychiatric patients, who are actively ill, often may not accept their diagnosis due to lack of insight or stigma attached to the condition. There are several interventions that aim to help clinicians to communicate life changing medical diagnoses to people; however, little is known specifically for delivering a diagnosis of schizophrenia.</background>\\n<objectives>To evaluate evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for the efficacy of different communication strategies used by clinicians to inform people about the diagnosis and outcome of schizophrenia compared with treatment as usual and to compare efficacy between different communication strategies.</objectives>\\n<search_methods>On 22 June 2015 and 29 June 2016, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study\\u2010Based Register of Trials. We also searched sources of grey literature (e.g., dissertations, theses, clinical reports, evaluations published on websites, clinical guidelines and reports from regulatory agencies).</search_methods>\\n<selection_criteria>We planned to include all relevant RCTs that included adults with schizophrenia or related disorders, including schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder and delusional disorder. The trials would have investigated the effects of communication strategy or strategies that helped clinicians deliver information specifically about a diagnosis of schizophrenia (which can also include communication regarding the treatment options available and prognosis).</selection_criteria>\\n<data_collection_and_analysis>Review authors independently examined all reports from the searches for any relevant studies. We planned to extract data independently. For binary outcomes, we would have calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention\\u2010to\\u2010treat basis. For continuous data, we would have estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We would have employed a random\\u2010effects model for analyses. We planned to assess risk of bias for included studies. We created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE.</data_collection_and_analysis>\\n<main_results>The searches identified 44 records which appeared to be relevant to the aims of the review. We obtained full reports for seven potential studies; however, after close inspection none of these studies met the inclusion criteria.</main_results>\\n<authors'_conclusions>Good communication of diagnosis can affect treatment planning, compliance and patient outcomes, especially in the case of conditions such as schizophrenia, which has the potential to cause serious life disruption for both people with schizophrenia and their carers. Currently, there is no evidence based on findings from RCTs assessing the effects of communication strategies for disclosing the diagnosis of schizophrenia and related disorders.

Your task is to generate very accurate PICO eligibility criteria (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome). <article_abstract> <article_title> Collinearity: a review of methods to deal with it and a simulation study evaluating their performance </article_title> <abstract>Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the \\u2018folk lore\\u2019-thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables of |r| >0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction. The use of ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis variable selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them.

Most of the studies applied bright light as adjunctive treatment to drug therapy, sleep deprivation, or both. In general, the quality of reporting was poor, and many reviews did not report adverse effects systematically. The treatment response in the bright light group was better than in the control treatment group, but did not reach statistical significance. The result was mainly based on studies of less than 8 days of treatment. The response to bright light was significantly better than to control treatment in high\\u2010quality studies (standardized mean difference (SMD) \\u20100.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) \\u20101.50 to \\u20100.31), in studies applying morning light treatment (SMD \\u20100.38, CI \\u20100.62 to \\u20100.14), and in sleep deprivation responders (SMD \\u20101.02, CI \\u20101.60 to \\u20100.45). Hypomania was more common in the bright light group compared to the control treatment group (risk ratio 4.91, CI 1.66 to 14.46, number needed to harm 8, CI 5 to 20).</main_results>\\n<authors'_conclusions>For patients suffering from non\\u2010seasonal depression, light therapy offers modest though promising antidepressive efficacy, especially when administered during the first week of treatment, in the morning, and as an adjunctive treatment to sleep deprivation responders. Hypomania as a potential adverse effect needs to be considered. Due to limited data and heterogeneity of studies these results need to be interpreted with caution.</authors'_conclusions> </article_abstract> Please provide your awnser in the following format: <format> Population: (PICO eligibility criteria 1), (PICO eligibility criteria 2), ...

Your task is to generate very accurate PICO eligibility criteria (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome). <article_abstract> <article_title> Monoamine oxidase B inhibitors for early Parkinson's disease </article_title> <background>Monoamine oxidase B (MAO\\u2010B) inhibitors slow disease progression in Parkinson's disease (PD) but clinical trials have produced conflicting results.</background>\\n<objectives>To assess the evidence from randomised controlled trials for the effectiveness and safety of long\\u2010term use of MAO\\u2010B inhibitors in early PD.</objectives>\\n<search_methods>We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 11, 2011), MEDLINE (last searched 8th November 2011) and EMBASE (last searched 8th November 2011); and handsearched neurology and movement disorders conference proceedings, checked reference lists of relevant studies and contacted other researchers.</search_methods>\\n<selection_criteria>We included all unconfounded randomised controlled trials that compared a MAO\\u2010B inhibitor with control, in the presence or absence of levodopa or dopamine agonists, in patients with early PD where treatment and follow up lasted at least one year.</selection_criteria>\\n<data_collection_and_analysis>Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the methodological quality, and extracted the data. Some additional data were provided by the original authors. Random\\u2010effects models were used to analyse results, where appropriate.</data_collection_and_analysis>\\n<main_results>Twelve trials were included (2514 patients, average follow\\u2010up six years), 11 using selegiline. The methodological quality was reasonable although concealment of allocation was definitely adequate in only five trials. MAO\\u2010B inhibitors were not associated with a significant increase in deaths (odds ratio (OR) 1.12; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.41). They provided small benefits over control in impairment (weighted mean difference (WMD) for change in motor UPDRS score 3.79 points less with MAO\\u2010B inhibitors; 95% CI 2.27 to 5.30) and disability (WMD for change in UPDRS ADL score 1.49 less; 95% CI 0.49 to 2.49) at one year which may not be clinically significant. There was a levodopa\\u2010sparing effect with MAO\\u2010B inhibitors, which was associated with a significant reduction in motor fluctuations (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.91) but not dyskinesia (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.22). The reduction in motor fluctuations was, however, not robust in sensitivity analyses. There was a trend to more withdrawals due to adverse events with MAO\\u2010B inhibitors (OR 1.72; 95% CI 0.98 to 3.01).</main_results>\\n<authors'_conclusions>MAO\\u2010B inhibitors (more specifically selegiline which contributes most of the data) do not appear to delay disease progression in terms of improved survival but may reduce later motor fluctuations. At present, we do not feel these drugs can be recommended for routine use in the treatment of early Parkinson's disease.</authors'_conclusions> </article_abstract> Please provide your awnser in the following format: <format> Population: (PICO eligibility criteria 1), (PICO eligibility criteria 2), ...

Your task is to generate very accurate PICO eligibility criteria (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome). <article_abstract> <article_title> Collinearity: a review of methods to deal with it and a simulation study evaluating their performance </article_title> <abstract>Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the \\u2018folk lore\\u2019-thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables of |r| >0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction. The use of ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis variable selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them.

We also sought trials from conference proceedings and references of included papers, and contacted the first author of each study as well as leading researchers in the field.</search_methods>\\n<selection_criteria>Randomised controlled trials comparing bright light with inactive placebo treatments for non\\u2010seasonal depression.</selection_criteria>\\n<data_collection_and_analysis>Data were extracted and quality assessment was made independently by two reviewers. The authors were contacted to obtain additional information.</data_collection_and_analysis>\\n<main_results>Twenty studies (49 reports) were included in the review. Most of the studies applied bright light as adjunctive treatment to drug therapy, sleep deprivation, or both. In general, the quality of reporting was poor, and many reviews did not report adverse effects systematically. The treatment response in the bright light group was better than in the control treatment group, but did not reach statistical significance. The result was mainly based on studies of less than 8 days of treatment. The response to bright light was significantly better than to control treatment in high\\u2010quality studies (standardized mean difference (SMD) \\u20100.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) \\u20101.50 to \\u20100.31), in studies applying morning light treatment (SMD \\u20100.38, CI \\u20100.62 to \\u20100.14), and in sleep deprivation responders (SMD \\u20101.02, CI \\u20101.60 to \\u20100.45). Hypomania was more common in the bright light group compared to the control treatment group (risk ratio 4.91, CI 1.66 to 14.46, number needed to harm 8, CI 5 to 20).</main_results>\\n<authors'_conclusions>For patients suffering from non\\u2010seasonal depression, light therapy offers modest though promising antidepressive efficacy, especially when administered during the first week of treatment, in the morning, and as an adjunctive treatment to sleep deprivation responders. Hypomania as a potential adverse effect needs to be considered. Due to limited data and heterogeneity of studies these results need to be interpreted with caution.</authors'_conclusions> </article_abstract> Please provide your awnser in the following format: <format> Population: (PICO eligibility criteria 1), (PICO eligibility criteria 2), ...

Some additional data were provided by the original authors. Random\\u2010effects models were used to analyse results, where appropriate.</data_collection_and_analysis>\\n<main_results>Twelve trials were included (2514 patients, average follow\\u2010up six years), 11 using selegiline. The methodological quality was reasonable although concealment of allocation was definitely adequate in only five trials. MAO\\u2010B inhibitors were not associated with a significant increase in deaths (odds ratio (OR) 1.12; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.41). They provided small benefits over control in impairment (weighted mean difference (WMD) for change in motor UPDRS score 3.79 points less with MAO\\u2010B inhibitors; 95% CI 2.27 to 5.30) and disability (WMD for change in UPDRS ADL score 1.49 less; 95% CI 0.49 to 2.49) at one year which may not be clinically significant. There was a levodopa\\u2010sparing effect with MAO\\u2010B inhibitors, which was associated with a significant reduction in motor fluctuations (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.91) but not dyskinesia (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.22). The reduction in motor fluctuations was, however, not robust in sensitivity analyses. There was a trend to more withdrawals due to adverse events with MAO\\u2010B inhibitors (OR 1.72; 95% CI 0.98 to 3.01).</main_results>\\n<authors'_conclusions>MAO\\u2010B inhibitors (more specifically selegiline which contributes most of the data) do not appear to delay disease progression in terms of improved survival but may reduce later motor fluctuations. At present, we do not feel these drugs can be recommended for routine use in the treatment of early Parkinson's disease.</authors'_conclusions> </article_abstract> Please provide your awnser in the following format: <format> Population: (PICO eligibility criteria 1), (PICO eligibility criteria 2), ...
